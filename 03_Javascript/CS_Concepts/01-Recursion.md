### Recursion
Recursion algorithms are algorithms that call themselves. In the simplest description, they can be regarded as `loops`. When implemented with a `for` or `while` loop, a *break* statement/condition is required which is included at the top of recursive functions.
- An example of calculating the power of a number
    ```JS
    // For loop with break condition "n"
    function pow(x, n) {
        let result = 1;

        // multiply result by x n times in the loop
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result *= x;
        }

        return result;
    };

    // Recursive implementation with if-else break statement
    function pow(x, n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return x; // aka known as base of recursion or the last step
        } else {
            return x * pow(x, n - 1);
        }
    };

    // Recursive implementation with ternary operator "?"
    function pow(x, n) {
        return (n == 1) ? x : (x * pow(x, n - 1));
    };
    ```
    The recursive implementation can be designed to be generally shorter than loop implementation.

#### Recursion Depth
The maximal number of nested calls (including the first one) is called *recursion depth*. This can also be envisaged like the longest length of the for/while loop. In the example above, it will be exactly `n` i.e. the maximum power value e.g. `pow(5, 2)`. The recursion depth is 2. The maximal recursion depth is limited by JavaScript engine. We can rely on it being 10000, some engines allow more, but 100000 is probably out of limit for the majority of them.  

Contexts take memory. In the `pow()` case, raising to the power of *n* actually requires the memory for *n* contexts, for all lower values of *n*. A loop 
can be more memory saving because it's memory requirements don't depend on *n*.

### Summary
- Recursion is a programming term that means calling a function from itself. Recursive functions can be used to solve tasks in elegant ways.
- When a function calls itself, thatâ€™s called a recursion step. The basis of recursion is function arguments that make the task so simple that the 
function does not make further calls.
- A recursively-defined data structure is a data structure that can be defined using itself e.g. linked-list.
