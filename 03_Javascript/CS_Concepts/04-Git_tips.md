### Update a commit
After committing a file/bunch of files, you can include additional files in the commit using 
```bash
git add newfile.txt
git commit --amend
```

### Updating multiple commits
- Rebase is an action to rewrite commits and their history. `git rebase -i` is a command which allows us to interactively stop after each commit 
weâ€™re trying to modify, and then make whatever changes we wish. We do have to tell this command which is the last commit we want to edit. For 
example, `git rebase -i HEAD~2` allows us to edit the last two commits.
- After editing a commit, use `git commit --amend` to update the changes to the commit.
- Complete the rebase with `git rebase --continue`.


### Merging multiple commits
Two or more commits can be merged using `squash` with the git interactive terminal commands. To force push changes from local to remote, 
`git push --force` can be used, however, it can delete remote files that have been modified when working with a team, hence it's recommended to 
use `git push --force-with-lease` instead.

### Recommendations
1. For `git commit --amend` never amend commits that have been pushed to remote repositories.
2. For `git rebase` never rebase a repository that others may work off of.
3. For `git reset` never reset commits that have been pushed to remote repositories.
4. For `git push --force` only use it when appropriate, use it with caution, and preferably default to using `git push --force-with-lease`.
5. View one git commit logs with `alias glg='git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color'`
