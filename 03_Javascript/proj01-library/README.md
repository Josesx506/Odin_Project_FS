### Library Project
The first implementation in the root folder uses a `constructor` object to define the class. After learning about `classes`, we were told to refactor the constructor into a class. I did that and further impelemented a ***counter*** with event messaging support (via pubSub) that counts the number of books in the class and updates it on the page. This is contained inside the `class_implementation` folder. I also included a form validation step prior to when books can be added to the library.
