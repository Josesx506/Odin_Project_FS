### Restaurant Project Pages
This a ***webpack*** reliant multi-page website. Each page is written entirely in JS and styled with css. Pages are exported as modules and rendered using a barebones template html file. <br>

Install popularly reused packages with `npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free css-loader file-loader html-webpack-plugin style-loader webpack webpack-cli`. <br>

Launch `dist/index.html` with live-server and run `npx webpack --watch` so that you will not have to rerun webpack every time you make a change.
