### Introduction
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). <br>

Where's Waldo involves identifying small objects amidst many other objects using the mouse. Similar to photo tagging, each click 
has a bounding box with a dropdown to select which character you believe exists at those coordinates. The logic of the game is 
to determine whether your logic is correct, and how fast it took you to find all the characters. <br>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
