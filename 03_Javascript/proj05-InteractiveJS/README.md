This is the first time I'm using JS linting on a project. Runs with node version >`v18`. Initialize it using a standard configuration file with `npm init @eslint/config@latest`, a couple of prompts are raised which you can respond to with the keyboard, following which an `eslint.config.mjs` file is created. <br>

You can lint a file with `npx eslint dir-name/ file-name.js`. This formats the file according the basic instructions in the config file that was created above and raises any errors for exceptions. 
*Note*: The errors are only raised and you have to go into the code to fix it manually. You can install the VSCode `ESLint` extension to check your code dynamically as you write for best practice recommendations. <br>

The dropdown page is essentially merging your nav bar into a 3 line view that's good for mobile design or small screens.
